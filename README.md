# Oscillation and particle systems C# Project1

## 3D environment: Created  "outdoor environment" in Unity, e.g. including the “terrain” tool.


## Harmonic oscillating motion:
 Created a 3D model for oil pump (see sketch above) which should rotate/rock on and off according to a simple harmonic oscillation motion. How violently it oscillates (amplitude A) and at what frequency (can also be specified as period T).


## Spring forces (Hooke's law): 
Created some kind of "wagon" with 4 wheels and a "box" on top. The wheels do not need to be able to rotate, but they can be implemented as fixed objects (feet). Between each wheel and the bottom edge of the "box" there should be an elastic shock absorber where each shock absorber generates a force that is directly proportional to how much the shock absorber is compressed. The shock absorbers must therefore follow Hooke's law for spring forces.

## Pendulum movement: 
The ball and the string/wire/chain it hangs from must behave like a 3-dimensional pendulum. If you e.g. moves the lifting crane straight ahead, the pendulum force must be the only force that causes the ball to move, i.e. the force to which the ball is subjected when the angle between the point where the string is attached to the crane and the ball itself is greater or less than 0 in the X or Z direction.
